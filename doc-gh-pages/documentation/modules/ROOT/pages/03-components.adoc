The main components in a Kafka architecture:

- **Broker:** node that orchestrates the storage and passing of messages.
- **Kafka Cluster:** group of broker instances.
- **ZooKeeper:** core dependency for Kafka that provides a cluster coordination service, storing and tracking the status of brokers and consumers. It's also used for controller elections. 
- **Kafka Connect:** integration toolkit for streaming data between Kafka brokers and other systems. Kafka Connect provides a framework to integrate Kafka with an external data source such as a database. A connector is a plugin composed by:
    * Source to extract the data from a source.
    * Sink to store the data into a Kafka topic. 
- **Kafka MirrorMaker:** replicates data between two Kafka clusters, within or across data centers.
- **Kafka Exporter:** extracts data for analysis.
