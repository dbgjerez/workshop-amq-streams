== Installation

[Abstract]
In this lab, we will install the AMQ Streams operator. 

Prerequisites: 

- An OCP cluster

Goals:

- Install operator

:numbered:
== **Lab10 - Installation**
The operator will be deployed using the descriptor: 

[source, yaml]
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dbgjerez/amq-streams-workshop/master/operator/amq-streams-operator.yaml[]

To apply the file, we will use the oc client to apply it on the namespace "openshift-operators".

....
oc apply -f operators/amq-streams-operator.yaml -n openshift-operators 
....

Now, we will check the status of the operators: 
....
oc get subscription -n openshift-operators
NAMESPACE             NAME          PACKAGE       SOURCE             CHANNEL
openshift-operators   amq-streams   amq-streams   redhat-operators   amq-streams-2.3.x
....

How we can see, the operator is installed and ready to be used.

If we have used the GitOps way, specifically ArgoCD, we will see this picture:
